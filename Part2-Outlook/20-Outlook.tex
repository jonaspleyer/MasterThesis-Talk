	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Plenty of information on numerical side
		\item Current work is (hopefully) well documented
		\item Should be able to obtain exact solution for $n\in\mathbb{N}, n>1$ analogously to $n=2$ cases
		\item Solvability of LE equation is known and well researched eg. \cite{quittnerSuperlinearParabolicProblems2007a}
		\item Solvability of TOV equation is complicated and subject of current research \cite{martinsExistenceClassificationPseudoAsymptotic2019, boonsermSolutionGeneratingTheorems2007}
		\item Mass limit of $M/R<4/9$ already known for border of star. Maybe possible to prove inside as well.
		\item Improve mass limits
	\end{itemize}
