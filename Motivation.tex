	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item TOV equation: differential equation, describes stars in GR
		\item Needs additional information to be solvable
		\item Thermodynamics yields this information
		\item Questions to answer:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Well defined radius?
			\item Mass limits?
		\end{itemize}
		\item Mathematically interesting: show that a solution of the differential equation has a zerovalue without knowing the solution
	\end{itemize}
